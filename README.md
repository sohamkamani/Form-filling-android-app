Form-filling-android-app
========================
A fully functional android app to fill a generic form and upload the contents to an online php script.

The only changes needed to be made for it to work independently are in the hosting website name and php file name in the "Uploader.java" file

On the php script the data is available in the $_REQUEST[key] variable
